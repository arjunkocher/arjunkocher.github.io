Sounds science fiction? Well it's not. Yes, it created a video from a still image.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d33dc3365ef751024d5ea0471f40f8d3" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>Google Images</figcaption></figure><p>An AI that could guess what's happening on the scene just by listening to the audio. It was consistently better than humans at doing this.</p><p>An AI that can predict human behaviour with training only watching sitcoms.</p><p>Imagine typing a descriptive sentence of scene and having an artificial intelligence generate a convincing photo realistic image just from your text input!</p><p>Let's build a bit of context here.</p><p>The type of AI we are about to get a glimpse of is called Neural Network, that's basically a computer system modeled after the human brain. There are processing nodes that act as neurons and the neuron layers behave as segments of the brain. This concept or idea is nothing new and has been around since the 1980s but it's only become feasible in the last 5 years due to GPUs with hundreds of cores being cheap and accessible, in addition to this the available open source tool for neural networks are making it easier to create, pushing progress parabolically faster.</p><p>Some examples of neural networks include Google's <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/" rel="noopener nofollow">AlphaGo </a>and also things like an AI capable of describing images in text form. Another interesting example is <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/" rel="noopener nofollow">WaveNet</a>, an AI that can generate raw sounds such as speech and music.</p><p>Let's take things further, shall we?</p><p>What if we combine two neural networks together and make them compete against each other so that they can improve themselves without human intervention. That's what AI called <a href="https://github.com/hanzhanggit/StackGAN" rel="noopener nofollow">StackGAN</a> is doing. It uses one neural network to generate images and another neural network within the same system to decide if the images generated are real or fake. What ends up happening is that the generative Neural-Nets improves itself at generating images based on the feedback given by the deciding network and in the same stride the deciding network gets better at distinguishing what's real and fake. This creates a feedback loop of continuous improvement without human intervention. The end process of this is a creation of a low resolution synthesized image. After this a second stage takes place, in the second stage the AI is told to clean up any defects in the original picture and the results are nothing short of stunning.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6bcae68108f752aa5b123466234030c0" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>Google Images</figcaption></figure><p>This type of dual network AI is called a Generative Adversarial Network and it's the same type of system that allowed the AI to dream up a video when shown still image. This form of Artificial Intelligence is actually brand new and was only invented in 2014 and already I'm beginning to think that this is one of the most powerful methods for Machine Learning. The text-to-image AI comes hot on the heals of an artificial intelligence from <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~noamb/papers/17-IJCAI-Libratus.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow">Carnegie Melon University </a>beating the world's best players of Texas Hold'em Poker.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://qphs.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5aa529a87e17f950b01bafb636efd0ef" class="kg-image" alt><figcaption>Google Images</figcaption></figure><p>There's also an AI that's been released by <a href="https://gamalon.com/" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamalon</a> a Boston Company, this one can rewrite its own code based on the experience and probabilities rather than hard variables, it's creators say that it could make the tedious part of coding AI completely automatic.</p><p>To give you an idea how fast some areas of AI are progressing here's what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfDQNrVphLQ" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff Dean</a>, a senior fellow at Google's Research group has to say:</p><p>"<em> To take an example the field of Computer Vision, every year there's a contest where teams compete to see who can give the right categories out of a thousand different categories when given an image. In 2011 before people were using neural-nets, the winning team got an error rate of 26%, which doesn't sound too good when you think that humans are at 5% on this task. But fast-forward it just 5 years and we are now at 3% using deep learning and much more computational power. Actually better than humans on this task.</em>"</p><p>So in a way, computers can now see and recognize objects better than us for the first time ever. This has never happened before.</p><p>Another example is how 'Unreliable' human ophthalmologists were for diagnosing certain eye diseases. In experiments any two ophthalmologists will only agree with each other's diagnosis 60% of the time. And what's worse, if you give any single ophthalmologists the exact same image that they diagnosed a few hours earlier they'll only agree with themselves 65% of the time.</p><p>In 2017, Artificial Intelligence image recognition has been proven to perform better than professional humans in this field.</p><p>Things have been progressing fast and may have taken some of you by surprise. It seems like playtime is over in regards to AI especially with techniques like deep learning and neural networks. I think such things will cause social discomfort as they begin to encroach jobs.</p><p>There's definitely both positives and negatives to this though, but the question is, What does all of this mean and what are we to do with all these continual shifts than what we thought was possible?</p><p>In a general sense Artificial Intelligence can be seen as a continuation of the Industrial Revolution happening over the past 200 years, even right now AI is helping in the medical field and making driving and other risky tasks safer.</p><p>In the future many mundane tasks can be handled by AI giving more free time for people to do more creative things. But, of course and I have heard this argument before "<strong>Not everyone is creative</strong>". Life needs to have meaning and for some individuals that meaning comes in the form of their day-to-day 9 to 5 jobs.</p><p>Of course, some of you must be thinking of the Skynet scenario from Terminator franchise. But right now it's far too early to predict the fully developed AI of the future, that would be like trying to predict today's computer industry from the point of view of the 1960s. Personally, I think what<strong> we should actually be worried about is, Who controls the AI?</strong> If the strong Artificial Intelligence of the the future is open source and available to everyone, there's a high probability that this will be a good thing. Here's a small example of an Open Source AI being put to good use. A farmer in Japan used AI, Computer Vision and robotics to enable his cucumbers to be automatically selected and categorized saving him hundreds of hours. The Artificial Intelligence driving his farm is called TensorFlow and it's open source and was created by Google. Maybe in the future instead of working in a company, there will be more common for people to run their own businesses with their own personal AI acting as a productivity aid. So that's an example of open source AI that are being used in a good way. But, conversely if some of the best AIs in the world is held in the hands of a few the probability of a good outcome overall drops significantly. In the later case, there may be a case of whoever owns the AI makes the rules. Same goes for the nuclear power.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>
